Statement of Purpose: Operational Plan & Professional Intent
Applicant: Arwen Lorenz Llubit Fabila
Focus: Dairy Cattle Production & Management
Reference Training: Nabunturan Farmers Multipurpose Cooperative (April – July 2025)
1. Background and Motivation
Personal Journey: My entry into the dairy industry is a deliberate career transition driven by a goal to secure a stable, high-value profession abroad. While the initial motivation was family-oriented—seeking better economic opportunities to support my household—this motivation evolved into a genuine professional passion during my training. I realized that my meticulous nature is perfectly suited for the disciplined environment of dairy farming.
Experience: My foundation is built on a rigorous 720-hour certification facilitated by Access Point Center and conducted at the Nabunturan Farmers Multipurpose Cooperative. For 90 days (April 5, 2025 – July 5, 2025), I lived the life of a dairy farmer, moving beyond theory into hands-on execution.
Inspiration: I am inspired by the systemic nature of dairy farming. I witnessed how strict adherence to sanitation protocols and animal welfare directly correlates to milk volume and quality. I am drawn to the challenge of maintaining these high standards daily.
2. Goals and Objectives
Short-term Goals: My immediate objective is to join a reputable dairy operation where I can deploy my training in real-time. I aim to master your specific farm’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) within the first 30 days, ensuring I am a fully autonomous and productive member of the team immediately.
Long-term Vision (5-10 Years): I see myself evolving from a general farm worker into a specialized Herd Manager or Technical Specialist. I plan to deepen my knowledge of automated milking technologies and advanced nutritional planning, eventually supervising teams and training new recruits in GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices).
Alignment with Audience: My goals align with a potential employer’s need for reliability and risk reduction. I am not just looking for a job; I am looking to be a long-term operational asset who minimizes errors and maximizes herd health.
3. Specific Plans and Methodology
Farm Operations Strategy: My methodology is "Safety First, Hygiene Always."
Milking: I strictly follow the milking routine: pre-milking stimulation, testing for mastitis, attaching cups efficiently, and applying post-dip to seal teats.
Feeding: I execute nutritional planning by carefully managing forage resources and ensuring precise ration delivery to maintain body condition scores.
Waste Management: I treat waste management not as a chore but as a biosecurity measure. My plan always involves immediate waste removal and proper segregation to prevent contamination.
Technology and Innovation: During my OJT, I utilized standard farm infrastructure. However, I possess strong computer skills (Data Encoding/Excel) which I plan to utilize for record-keeping. I am eager to learn and adapt to automated herd monitoring systems (collars/tags) and robotic milking interfaces.
Contribution to Financial Health: While I am not the business owner, my work directly impacts the bottom line. By detecting early signs of illness (e.g., mastitis or lameness) and maintaining strict hygiene, I help reduce veterinary costs and prevent milk grading penalties. My plan is to be cost-effective by being proactive.
4. Expected Impact
Economic Impact: My efficiency contributes to the farm's productivity. By ensuring cows are handled with low stress, milk let-down is improved, and residual milk is minimized. My accurate data recording ensures management has correct numbers for decision-making.
Environmental Impact: I am committed to sustainable practices, specifically in Environmental Sanitation. I ensure that chemical run-off is controlled during cleaning and that organic waste is managed according to the farm’s environmental protocols to protect local water sources.
Personal Growth: This endeavor allows me to elevate my professional standard to a global level. It transforms me from a trainee into a master of the trade, capable of working anywhere in the world while providing a better future for my family.
